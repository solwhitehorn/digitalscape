description: The sun is setting upon the land of Valisthea. For centuries, people have flocked to her Mothercrystals to partake of their blessingâ€”the abundant aether that fuels the magicks they rely upon in their everyday lives. As the aether begins to fade and the lifeless deadlands spread ever further, so too does the struggle for possession of the final flickers of the Mothers' light grow ever more fierce.
